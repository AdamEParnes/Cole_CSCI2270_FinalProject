# Cole_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This program reads in a file (Provided by command line, or using the default in the directory).  From that file, a tree is built in alphabetical order using the titles.  Vectors are created containing each individual console and genre.  User can then search for games, print all games of a certain system/genre, rent/trade games, add a new game or have a game recommended based on their requirements.  Many of the inputs allow the user to enter the system/genre of their game in addition to the title, so as to search the smaller vectors of games with similar attributes instead the full tree alphabetically, saving some time (as much as a tree size of 20 can save).  User needs to download Tree.h, Tree.cpp, main.cpp, and gameList.txt.  gameList.txt can be a command line argument but not required for files to run if gameList.txt is in the same directory
