# Cole_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Reading in a file of games which have the these variables: name, systems, genre, quanity, rating.
Using this informaton, we will create a binary search tree that is sorted alphabetically.  From  there, we will sort the 
nodes into vectors that are diveded by the differeny variables attached to it.  So the user will be able to search for movies in the tree,
search by genre, search by system, rent game, add game, get a recommendation, count nodes, and such.  So they are able to access the tree
and the vectors that point to the tree nodes
